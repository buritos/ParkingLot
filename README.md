# ParkingLot
A program for assigning parking spaces to cars entering a parking lot.

Each space has a desirability and cars are assigned to the best spaces in a first come first served fashion. Since the parking lot has several entries and exits and cars come and go simultaneously, the program must ensure that no car is assigned to an already occupied or assigned space. Moreover, cars may behave unexpectedly, parking at a different spot than the one they where assigned. The program must be able to deal with such unexpected behaviour in a graceful way.

The program was developed for the purpose of demonstrating programming skills as part of a technical interview.
